iBluff - Geomorphic Analysis of Coastal Bluffs/Cliffs

The iBluff package in the R language provides an environment for conducting morphological 
analysis of coastal bluffs / cliffs and offers an automatic and reproducible 
alternative for identifying top and toe instead of hand digitizing. This package 
extracts elevation profiles along automatically identified pseudo-perpendicular 
transects on the bluff face, bluff/cliff top, toe, secondary inflections, relative 
concavity/convexity of bluff/cliff face, and beach dunes (dune crests and troughs) 
without knowing a priori the number of dunes to be identified. 
The justification for the iBluff package is that automatic procedures are fully
reproducible and comparable, resulting in comprehensive features derived independently
of human skill. The positions of coastal bluff/cliff tops and toes are considered 
key indicators of bluff/cliff erosion and the quantification of bluff/cliff retreat 
rates is vital for stakeholders who manage coastal protection and land use. Automatic 
extraction of bluff/cliff top and toe positions from topographic data will provide 
valuable constraints on coastal dynamics that will aid planning decisions, particularly 
where multitemporal data are available, and thus facilitate better understanding of 
coastal change.
